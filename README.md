Container for executing pytest tests and Ansible roles on network devices, especially (our favorite) Juniper network devices.

The test framework [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) is a simple yet powerful developer-friendly test framework that unleashes the full power of [Python 3](https://docs.python-guide.org) and [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/network/getting_started/index.html) to automate network validation.


## __pytest__ Features

![pytest](images/pytest-logo.png)

The [pytest test automation framework](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) provides a rich set of capabilities including:

1. Detailed info on failing assert statements (no need to remember self.assert* names);
2. Auto-discovery of test modules and functions;
3. Modular fixtures for managing small or parametrized long-lived test resources;
4. Rich plugin architecture, with over 315+ external plugins and thriving community;

This container packs the plugins and libraries that are well-supported and particularly useful for Network Automation, including:

## __Ansible__ Features

![Ansible](images/ansible-logo.png)

Ansible is a staple in network automation.  Many customers already have their [inventory in an Ansible-friendly yaml or ini](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_inventory.html) format.  For customers that haven't, we recommend that we steer our customers in this direction.  It's easy enough to [generate an inventory dynamically via a script](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_dynamic_inventory.html) as well from a database or any other static format.  Once this information is available as an Ansible inventory, it can be leveraged in *any* Ansible script or pytest network validation.

The standard [Ansible distribution comes standard with modules to manage network devices](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/list_of_network_modules.html) from many major network equipment providers, including, most-importantly [Junos devices](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/list_of_network_modules.html#junos).

## __Usage__

This container can be used two basic ways:

1. Mounting one or two volumes, one for tests and another for test results.
2. Fork this repo.  Your tests should go into a tests directory.  A volume should be mounted to place the test results.  This allows you to add new python modules.  These python modules may contain standard test suites that are added to the test container.

### Mounting Tests and Output

Mount the tests you want to execute if you want to use a pre-built container and you're sure the pre-built container provides all necessary dependencies.  All python code named ```test_*``` will be scanned for tests.  

Any argument can be supplied via ```pytest.ini``` or as arguments to the ```docker run``` command.

If you want to be sure that your container has all the dependencies required to execute at build time

1. The container can be used as-is by mounting test could (files names ```test_*```) into /tests in the container.  Any argument can be supplied via ```pytest.ini``` or as arguments to the ```docker run``` command.
2. In the ```pytest.ini``` packaged with your tests, you can specify all options, including the expected test output directory.  By convention, this can be in a directory named 

### Forking the Container

### Organizing Tests

Note that it's also possible to organize tests in python modules that can be packaged and imported as dependencies from an (internal) pypi repo.

### Development Environment

You must have the following:

1. bash
2. docker
3. make
4. Python 3.6 or better

To set up your development environment, simply run ```make test```.

If you wish to try running py.test interactively on the command line, you'll need to do the following _additional_ steps:

1. ```export PIPENV_VENV_IN_PROJECT=1```
2. ```export PIPENV_VERBOSITY=-1```
3. ```export ANSIBLE_PYTHON_INTERPRETER=python3```

The ```export``` lines can be added to your profile (e.g.-- ```~/.bash_profile```), so you never have to set them again.

Tests should be run from the pipenv shell.  You can do this as follows (If you look at the ```Makefile``` target ```test```, it essentially does the same thing):

1. ```pipenv shell```
2. ```cd tests```
3. ```py.test```

### __Examples__

#### Setup: Installing a VSRX Topology for Demo purposes

For this demo, you will need to have the following additional software installed on your computer:

1. VirtualBox
2. Vagrant

The [vqfx10k-vagrant](https://github.com/Juniper/vqfx10k-vagrant.git) repo is included as a subtree in the ```examples/vqfx10k-vagrant``` directory.  Make targets have been added for each of the topologies to assist you with test development.

For more information on the supported topologies, click the link in the _Name_ column above.

##### Usage

Each topology has three make target actions: ```up```,```down``` and ```destroy```.  To form the target name simple prepend the target action to the topology name.  

__To bring up and provision the topology ```light-2qfx```, simply run:__

``` bash
make up-light-2qfx
```

If the topology support Ansible provisioning, then a provisioning script is run after the system(s) come up.  The inventory file can be found in topology directory, under ```.vagrant/provisioners/ansible/inventory/vagrant_ansible_inventory```.  It's in ```ini``` format.  This can be used for subsequent Ansible playbooks, and as inventory for ```pytest```.

To stop (but not destroy) it:

``` bash
make halt-light-2qfx
```

To destroy it:

``` bash
make destroy-light-2qfx
```

$ pipenv run py.test --csv=report.csv
...
$ cat report.csv

```

##### HTML

By default, the style.css is generated into an ```assets``` folder in the same directory as the HTML report.  If you don't like that, use the ```--self-contained-html``` flag.

``` bash
$ pipenv run py.test --html=report.html  --self-contained--html
```
![pytest HTML report](images/report-html.png)

##### JSON

The JSON report will dump out a JSON data blob that contain the results of all individual tests and what was logged.

``` bash
$ pipenv run py.test --json-report --json-report-file=report.json
...
$ jq .summary report.json
{
  "passed": 4,
  "total": 4
}
```

There is also a ```--json-report-summary``` option to only indicate if the entire suite passed.

##### Coverage

There are a variety of code coverage options.  Just specify a path to report code coverage on, and a report type.

``` bash
$ pipenv run py.test --cov=examples --cov-report=term --cov-branch
...
---------- coverage: platform darwin, python 3.7.4-final-0 -----------
Name                    Stmts   Miss Branch BrPart  Cover
---------------------------------------------------------
examples/test_2qfx.py      37      0      2      0   100%
```

##### Test Exectution Time

Use the ```---durations=0``` flag to make pytest report all test durations.  You can pass it a number to say the minimum slowest test you want the duration to be reported for.

``` bash
$ pipenv run py.test --durations=0
...
========================================= slowest test durations =========================================
1.00s call     examples/test_2qfx.py::test_junos_alarms
0.48s call     examples/test_2qfx.py::test_interfaces_up
0.16s call     examples/test_2qfx.py::test_get_inventory

(0.00 durations hidden.  Use -vv to show these durations.)
======================================== 4 passed in 2.05 seconds ========================================
```

##### Style

It's highly recommended that you validate your code style during test execution to avoid errors.

``` bash
$ pipenv run py.test --codestyle
